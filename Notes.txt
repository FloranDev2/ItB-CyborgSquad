"Burrower boss had a pretty dope design honestly"

Web immunity -> Secret Squad II -> pawns.lua
The trait is on the pilots.lua file iirc

CustomAnim: simple example
Unfair tweaks by arro -> nano mech's weapon

TODO:

Scorpion:
- Some issue when restarting the path with the Scorpion
- Add path for the scorpion
- Finish the implementation of fake small steps:
	- Set space one by one the pawns, BUT, still use the move, so the preview show something good

Burrower:
- I managed to deploy it in water. I should find a way to not authorize that. Maybe non-massive deploy lib?

Bouncer:
- It seems that throwing a shielded enemy into a webbing enemy will keep the web
	Can I fix that?


- I threw a blob into a Blobber and none of them took damage. 

- I need to check again the armor verification for the damage calculation


- Throwing an enemy into a frozen one took the wrong amount of damage

Burrower:
- 


Suggestions:
- Add click on p1 to do the regular push
- Web immune

- Fix the corner click that makes the scorpion 5 range
- Self damage equals to half the range on Bouncer's weapon
- Try to fix Scorpion's exp gain ()


Description:
"The power of the Vek in the palm of my hand..."
"Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Only one way to know!"

Somewhere, in a distant timeline, the secret cyborg project has taken a completely different turn...
