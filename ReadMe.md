# Truelch's Cyborg Squad (v1.0.2)

I'm finally releasing this squad, that was supposed to bring me back to modding some months (years?) ago.
All feedback is welcome, especially to squish these pesky Vek, I mean bugs!

## Credits
Special thanks to:
- Generic: helping me with various things, like the Bumper move animation and web immunity!
- Lemonymous: as always, scripting help (notably for the tile "un-craking" stuff)

## Description

### Scorpion Mech
It can grab nearby enemies and move with them to lure them in dangerous position! (or drown them in water)

### Bouncer Mech
Can either push an enemy or throw it into another enemy, killing the enemy with the lowest health and the.
The throw put a lot of stress on the cyborg muscles of the Bouncer, self-damaging it.

### Burrower Mech
Can sneak up to the enemy by moving underground, obstacles. Its attack deal damage to the main target, and push sideways tiles.
Can also safely target a building (without damaging it), pushing nearby enemies outward.
Due to its nature, the Burrower can withstand pushing attacks without moving (which can be handy in certain situations), but cannot go on water tiles.

## TODO
- Achievements
- Improve readibility of Scorpion's attack by displaying the current path (QoL improvement)
