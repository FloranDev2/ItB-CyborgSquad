Burrower boss had a pretty dope design honestly

Web immunity -> Secret Squad II -> pawns.lua
The trait is on the pilots.lua file iirc

CustomAnim: simple example
Unfair tweaks by arro -> nano mech's weapon

TODO:

Scorpion:
- Some issue when restarting the path with the Scorpion
- Add path for the scorpion
- Finish the implementation of fake small steps:
	- Set space one by one the pawns, BUT, still use the move, so the preview show something good

Burrower:
- I managed to deploy it in water. I should find a way to not authorize that. Maybe non-massive deploy lib?

Bouncer:
- Ice causes an issue with Bouncer's weapon: no damage will be dealt.
	(in the case I throw a non frozen unit into one, don't know for the reversed situation)
- Bouncer's weapon allows to damage an enemy by with a stable enemy. The stable unit IS NOT thrown
	(and not damaged since it doesn't reach P3).
- When Sweep attack is upgraded, the preview of the self damage is wrong.
- Also, each attacked tile as a delay
- Networked Shielding seems to cause issues with this too...
	(thrown a boulder into one of my mech, one of them took damage and the boulder and the Mech shares the same tile now)
- Need to fix effects of the Bouncer's attack

After modification:
- It seems that throwing a shielded enemy into a webbing enemy will keep the web (error1)
	Can I fix that?

- After putting nil when try to throw a Guarding (stable) pawn, I just can't attack stable pawns anymore! -> Seems to be fixed
  We should be able to use the regular punch attack
