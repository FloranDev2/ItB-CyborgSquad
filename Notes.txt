"Burrower boss had a pretty dope design honestly"

Web immunity -> Secret Squad II -> pawns.lua
The trait is on the pilots.lua file iirc

CustomAnim: simple example
Unfair tweaks by arro -> nano mech's weapon

TODO:

Scorpion:
- Some issue when restarting the path with the Scorpion
- Add path for the scorpion
- Finish the implementation of fake small steps:
	- Set space one by one the pawns, BUT, still use the move, so the preview show something good

Burrower:
- I managed to deploy it in water. I should find a way to not authorize that. Maybe non-massive deploy lib?

Bouncer:
- Ice causes an issue with Bouncer's weapon: no damage will be dealt.
	(in the case I throw a non frozen unit into one, don't know for the reversed situation)
- Networked Shielding seems to cause issues with this too... -> fixed?
- Need to fix effects of the Bouncer's attack -> fixed?

- It seems that throwing a shielded enemy into a webbing enemy will keep the web
	Can I fix that?


- I threw a blob into a Blobber and none of them took damage.
